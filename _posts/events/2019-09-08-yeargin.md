We'll consider these questions, looking at three cases as reported in both the US and Chinese press.  The goal of the presentation is to help persons who are not  familiar with the American legal system to understand it better. To help participants understand and contribute to the discussion, the news accounts used for illustration will be those relating to:

                   -- Zhang Koukou, reported in Sixthtone.com and  the South China Morning Post
                   --  Jesus Mora Flores, report by the Associated Press in the New York Times
                   --  Zhang Yingying, reported in the China Daily (http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/2019-07/22/content_37493975.html)

Although one Chinese case will be discussed and a Chinese news report is used to illustrate an American case, this presentation is not intended to offer a comprehensive comparison of Chinese and American legal systems.  Comparisons may occur to participants during the course of the presentation.  These may, of course, be discussed.
