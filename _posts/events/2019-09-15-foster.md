## 活动介绍
Artist-Explorer Tony Foster is a plein air artist who lives in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Since 1982, Tony has created a series of watercolor journeys in the world’s great wildernesses. Currently, Foster is working on his 17th journey.

A journey is a series of paintings with associated notes and symbolic objects or “souvenirs” made with the intention of revealing wild places or exploring a specific idea or theme. The theme may have geographic focus or be global in scope. Each journey includes multiple expeditions and can take years to complete.
