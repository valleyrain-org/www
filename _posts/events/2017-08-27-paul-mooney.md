《路透社资深驻华记者谈记者生涯》


## 分享内容 

I’d like to talk about my work while based in Beijing for 18 years as a foreign correspondent, from 1994-2012. I wrote about a wide variety of topics, but my main interest was reporting on social justice issues, human rights and society. I would give a talk on the kind of reporting I did, as well as on how literature influenced my interest in reporting.
