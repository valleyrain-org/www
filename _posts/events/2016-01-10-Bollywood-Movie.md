## 分享人：Bhanu Pratap Singh
Bollywood Writer & Movie Director 

Our speaker Bhanu Pratap Singh has been with the Indian film industry for 9 years. He was always very passionate about going to watching movies but didn’t know that he is going to choose filmmaking as his future career. In 2006, he moved to Mumbai, the city of dreams and the financial district of India to start his career in the Indian film industry. He spent his first two years at the best filmmaking school of India: Whistling Wood. Ever since 2009 Bhanu has been with the Bollywood film industry with different roles such as production assistant, casting director, actor, assistant director and finally script writer.
