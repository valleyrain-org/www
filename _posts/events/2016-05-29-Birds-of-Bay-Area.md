## 分享人： Yiwei Wang
Yiwei was born in Beijing but grew up and lived in the Bay Area most of her life. She attended Cornell University and double majored in Biology and Psychology. Returning to the west coast, she worked throughout California on many species of birds and mammals. She then attended UC Santa Cruz and received her PhD in Environmental Studies in 2013. Her dissertation focused on learning how human development impacts mountain lions and their relationships with other smaller carnivores. After completing her Ph.D., she worked with Save the Elephants in northern Kenya to study how human settlements are affecting elephants and to increase awareness of elephant poaching for ivory. Most recently she was a post-doctoral scholar in Santa Barbara, where she worked to increase and facilitate the management and sharing of ecological data.

## 分享书目 《The birds of the Bay Area》

Come on a walk to learn about the birds of the Bay Area. The Bay Area is not only home to people from around the world, but also an important place for migrating birds and birds raising their families. We will first visit Ulistac Natural Area, in Santa Clara, one of the last open parks in Silicon Valley, and then go visit the Environmental Education Center in Alviso and see the waterbirds. I will also talk about why it's important to protect lands for birds and how helping wildlife can help people as well. There will be opportunities to learn about how to get involved with the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory and to help wildlife in the Bay Area.
