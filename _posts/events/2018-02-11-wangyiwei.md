## 分享人介绍
Yiwei Wang, born in Beijing but grew up and lived in the Bay Area most of her life. She attended Cornell University and double majored in Biology and Psychology. Returning to the west coast, she worked throughout California on many species of birds and mammals. She then attended UC Santa Cruz and received her PhD in Environmental Studies in 2013. Her dissertation focused on learning how human development impacts mountain lions and their relationships with other smaller carnivores. After completing her Ph.D., she worked with Save the Elephants in northern Kenya to study how human settlements are affecting elephants and to increase awareness of elephant poaching for ivory. Most recently she was a post-doctoral scholar in Santa Barbara, where she worked to increase and facilitate the management and sharing of ecological data.

初春一起去看鳥


## 分享内容 
During the winter, many birds spend their time in the Bay Area to escape the cold weather. This is also the time of the year when many birds are in their breeding plumage, looking colorful and fancy while trying to attract mates. We will walk around the ponds in the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge in Alviso to get close up looks of these beautiful birds in our backyard. Depending on our walking speed, we will walk 2-3 miles. Bring water, sunglasses, sunblock, hat, and wear good walking shoes.
