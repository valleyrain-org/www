Gabby Wen is an improviser, composer, sound/performance artist, who often employs improvisation, synthesis and movement. Born in Taishan, Guangdong, raised in Shenzhen and the East Bay, she is currently based in San Francisco, CA. She embraces the stochastic and disordered nature of the reality, the obsolete, and the dysfunctional, but equally appreciates the peace and the unwavering.
