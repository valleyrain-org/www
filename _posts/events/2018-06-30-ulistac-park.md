## 活动内容 
Enjoy a leisurely walk at ulistac park, the last open space in Santa Clara from 9-11AM on June 30th. Ulistac contains many native plants found within California and the wildlife (birds, butterflies, insects, etc) that feed and live within those plants. Eric and Miranda, biologists from the San Francisco Bay Bird observatory, will take participants on a 2 hour walk through the park. You will learn about native California plants, birds and maybe even insects! 

Bring a hat, good walking shoes, water, and binoculars. Eric and Miranda will also bring some binoculars and bird books for participants to use.

ulistac information http://www.ulistac.org/ (I do recommend supporting the park if people like their experience). They can also volunteer there and do gardening.


Unless anyone wants to join us as a member ($40/year and access to other walks and talks), we would charge $10/person for the tour. You can also suggest they donate to Ulistac Park after the walk if they like it and want to support it.
